TODO:
-> Make preprocess high priority but let it ignore all *.preprocessed.*
-> Maybe add further parsing for e.g. date and title inside pdf
-> At some point do something intelligent to determine file and folder number
   maybe check for "suitable" folder according to tags and stuff
-> Write usefull tests!
-> Add config option to choose which image format is used for tesseract
   (right now tiff)
-> Make util class and move e.g. strip_whitespace... into it
-> Determine which filenumbers are not used (for now the highest free filenumber is shown in help_text)
